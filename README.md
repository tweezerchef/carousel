In-progress carousel for MUI/REACT
When creating my large book/social media project I couldn't find any prebuilt
MUI component nor a tutorial for creating one.  So I'm making this for y'all!
Right now its just a simple carousel that I'm using the basic "card" example from MUI and
creating an array of duplicates 9/27/2023
more to come very soon
To see the carousel in action and run locally, clone the repo
the go into the carousel directory run
npm install
and then
npm start
in a new terminal window run
npx ts-node server.ts
```Thats it!```
I'm also creating a tutorial heres the work in progress
