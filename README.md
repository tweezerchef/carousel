# carousel
# In-progress carousel for MUI/REACT
# When creating my large book/social media project I couldn't find any prebuilt MUI component nor a tutorial for creating one.  So I'm making this for y'all!

# the first carousal is static and does not require a database the second one is dynamic and requires a database
# To see the carousel in action and run locally, clone the repo the go into the carousel directory

# open the sampleENV file and follow the instructions to set up your own database or use the one I have set up for you them rename that file .env
# then run
npm install
# and then
npm start
# in a new terminal window run
npx ts-node server.ts
# ```Thats it!```
# I'm also creating a tutorial heres the first part
