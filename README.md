# Carousel for MUI/React

An in-progress carousel component for MUI/React. While working on a large book/social media project, I couldn't find a prebuilt MUI component or a tutorial for creating a carousel. So, I decided to make one for the community!

## Features

- **Static Carousel**: Doesn't require a database.
- **Dynamic Carousel**: Requires a database setup.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository** and navigate to the directory:

```bash
   cd carousel
 ```
## Setup Environment

1. Open the `sampleENV` file.
2. Follow the instructions to set up your own database or use the provided setup.
3. Rename the file to `.env`.

## Install Dependencies and Start the Application

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
## Run the Server (in a New Terminal Window)

```bash
npx ts-node server.ts
```
## Tutorial

I'm also in the process of creating a tutorial. Check out the first part:
- [Crafting a Professional-looking Carousel with React and MUI](https://medium.com/@ltomblock/crafting-a-professional-looking-carousel-with-react-and-mui-746a86af0ab0)

## Live Demo

Check out the deployed version (still basic). If it's down, please let me know:
