# Prisma supports the native connection string format for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB and CockroachDB.
# See the documentation for all the connection string options: https://pris.ly/d/connection-strings
# replace the DB with your database connection string on the "first one" and delete the second one if you wish to set up your own database
# if not remove the first database url and uncomment the second one this will allow you to have read only access to the database I have set up for this project
# and rename file to .env


# first one
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"

# second one
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://readonly:password@test.crp26csxmim6.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/test"
